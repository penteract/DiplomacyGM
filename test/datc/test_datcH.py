            If a unit is dislodged by an army via convoy, the question arises whether the dislodged army can retreat
            to the original place of the convoyed army. This is only relevant in case the convoy was to an adjacent
            place.

            If for issue 4.A.3 choice b or c has been taken, then the army in Gascony will not move with the use of
            the convoy, because the army in Marseilles does not move in opposite direction. This immediately means that
            the army in Marseilles may not move to Gascony when it dislodged by the army there.
            For all other choices of issue 4.A.3, the army in Gascony takes a convoy and does not pass the border of
            Gascony with Marseilles (it went a complete different direction). Now, the result depends on which rule
            is used for retreating (see issue 4.A.5).
            I prefer the 1982/2000 rule for convoying to adjacent places. This means that the move of Gascony happened

            The previous test case can be made more extra ordinary, when both armies tried to move by convoy.
            England: A Liverpool - Edinburgh via Convoy
            England: F Irish Sea Convoys A Liverpool - Edinburgh
            England: F English Channel Convoys A Liverpool - Edinburgh

            France: F Mid-Atlantic Ocean Supports F Brest - English Channel
            Russia: A Edinburgh - Liverpool via Convoy
            Russia: F Norwegian Sea Convoys A Edinburgh - Liverpool
            Russia: F North Atlantic Ocean Convoys A Edinburgh - Liverpool
            Russia: A Clyde Supports A Edinburgh - Liverpool
            If for issue 4.A.3 choice c has been taken, then the army in Liverpool will not try to move by convoy,
            because the convoy is disrupted. This has as consequence that army will just advance to Edinburgh by using
            the land route. For all other choices of issue 4.A.3, both the army in Liverpool as in Edinburgh will try
            to move by convoy. The army in Edinburgh will succeed. The army in Liverpool will fail, because of the
            disrupted convoy. It is dislodged by the army of Edinburgh. Now, the question is whether the army in
            Liverpool may retreat to Edinburgh. The result depends on which rule is used for retreating (see issue
            4.A.5). I prefer the 1982/2000 rule for convoying to adjacent places. This means that the army in Liverpool
            tries the disrupted convoy. Furthermore, I prefer that the army in Liverpool may retreat to Edinburgh.
